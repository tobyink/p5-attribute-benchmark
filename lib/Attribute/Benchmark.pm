=head1 NAME

Attribute::Benchmark - dead easy benchmarking

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   #!/usr/bin/env perl
   
   use Attribute::Benchmark;
   
   sub foo :Benchmark
   {
      1 for 0..10;
   }
   
   sub bar1 :Benchmark(bar)
   {
      1 for 0..1000;
   }

That's all folks!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Attribute::Benchmark> provides a C<:Benchmark> attribute for subs.
Just import it into a script, write the subs you wish to compare, and
add the C<:Benchmark> attribute to each. Then run your script.

No need to C<use strict> or C<use warnings> - Attribute::Benchmark
does that for you.

By default Attribute::Benchmark uses C<< cmpthese(-1, \%subs) >> but
the iteration count can be changed in the import statement:

   use Attribute::Benchmark (100);

Don't forget the parentheses; otherwise Perl will assume you want
version 100.0 of Attribute::Benchmark!

Attribute::Benchmark will use the name of the sub as the label for the
benchmark results (e.g. "foo" above). But you can provide an explicit
label for a result like:

   sub bar1 :Benchmark(bar)

Easy, peasy, lemon squeezy.
